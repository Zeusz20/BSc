[object]
Both players choose an object at the beginning of the game.
Each object has a set of attributes and an image which describes them.

[attribute]
Attributes are generalized properties of objects.
The values describe the specific properties which the objects possess,
i.e. color - red.

The question, which asks about the attribute, must contain the word "{$attr}"
where the application will substitute a value chosen by the player.

[question]
Something about questions.
